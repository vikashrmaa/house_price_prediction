(Sample dataset)

The House Price Predictor is a machine learning-based application designed to estimate house prices based on key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location. The model is trained on historical housing data and utilizes regression techniques to make accurate predictions.

Features
Machine Learning Model: Uses a trained regression model to predict house prices.
Data Processing: Cleans and processes housing data to extract meaningful insights.
Flask API: Provides a REST API endpoint for real-time predictions.
User Input: Accepts details like square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms to generate price estimates.
Scalability: Can be expanded to include more features such as locality demand, crime rates, and nearby amenities.
Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Flask
Model Storage: Pickle for saving and loading trained models
Deployment: Flask-based API for serving predictions
How It Works
The model is trained on a dataset of historical house prices.
It learns patterns based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.
Users can input house details via an API request.
The trained model predicts and returns an estimated price.
Use Cases
Real Estate Agents: Provides quick price estimates for clients.
Home Buyers/Sellers: Helps in making informed decisions.
Investment Analysis: Assists investors in evaluating property prices.
This project can be enhanced with additional features such as location-based data integration and visualization tools for better insights.
